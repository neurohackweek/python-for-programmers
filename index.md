This lesson will teach you some of the basics of the Python programming
language. It assumes that you have some experience programming in another
interpreted language. In particular, it is meant to help users of Matlab
recognize the similarities and differences between these two languages.

It is based on materials written by Justin Kitzes as part of his [Data Science Lectures](http://datasci.kitzes.com/lessons/python/), with input from Matt Davis and Greg Wilson.

The materials are based on a tour through the 7 elements that [every programming system must have](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/08/applying-pedagogical-principles-in-this-course.html):

1.	Individual things (the number 2, the string 'hello', a figure)
2.	Commands that operate on things (the `+` symbol, the `len` function)
3.	Groups of things (lists, arrays, tuples, dictionaries)
4.	Ways to repeat yourself (`for` and `while` loops)
5.	Ways to make choices (`if` and `try` statements)
6.	Ways to create chunks (functions, objects/classes, modules)
7.	Ways to combine chunks (function composition)

This lesson template is based on the lesson template used in [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops,
